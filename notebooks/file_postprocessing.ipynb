    "# *Figure 3: Delay-Filtered Visibility Delay Spectra after `smooth_cal`* and Redundant Averaging\n",
    "\n",
    "This figure plots delay spectra for autocorrelations and 1, 2, 4, and 8 unit East-west baselines. The delay-spectra are computed by FFTing the visibilities with a Blackman-Harris taper and then taking the absolute value. The delay spectra of visibility sums are delay-filtered. The delay spectra of visibility diffs are generated by simply setting their flagged channels to 0. For autocorrelations, only inpainting is performed. These delay spectra are plotted for both polarizations and in both the high (above FM) and low (below FM) bands. Note that the frequency ranges over which the delay-filtering was performed might be slightly larger than bands shown here since flagged channels at band edges were excluded from the FFT."
